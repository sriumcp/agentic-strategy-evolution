# Claude-Based PR Creation Workflow

This document defines the standard workflow for contributors using Claude Code to address issues and create pull requests in this repository.

---

## Non-negotiable rules

These apply to every PR, every test, every contributor. They are also restated in the auto-loaded `CLAUDE.md` files at the repo root and under `tests/`.

### 🚫 Tests must NEVER make live LLM calls

**No unit, integration, or end-to-end test in this repo may make a real API call to Anthropic, OpenAI, or any other LLM provider.** Tests must mock LLMs at the dispatcher seam:

- `LLMDispatcher` → pass `completion_fn=`.
- `CLIDispatcher` → patch `orchestrator.cli_dispatch.subprocess.run`.
- `SDKDispatcher` → pass `sdk_runner=` returning `SDKResult`.
- `InlineDispatcher` → pre-populate the `.nous_response_*` signal file.
- Or use `StubDispatcher` for end-to-end orchestrator flows.

`tests/conftest.py` installs an autouse `block_live_llm_calls` fixture that strips LLM API keys from the env and patches `urllib.request.urlopen` + `claude_agent_sdk.query` to hard-fail on real network calls. If a test trips the guard, fix the test by injecting a fake — never disable the guard.

### Behavioral testing only

Assert what's on disk, what's in metrics rows, what schemas validate. Don't assert which methods were called or what argv was constructed. The dispatcher seams are the contract.

### Token-budget discipline

`nous` runs against real LLMs in production; CI cannot. Every PR that touches `orchestrator/` must keep the cache-friendly invariant: methodology lives in `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded), system blocks are stable across calls (cache hits), per-iteration content goes in the user message (cache busts when it should). `nous cost --cache-stats` is the regression gate.

## Overview

Any contributor with Claude Code should follow this workflow when working on an issue. It combines AI-assisted planning and review with explicit human approval gates to produce consistent, high-quality contributions.

---

## Step 1: Create a Worktree

**Before any work**, isolate your changes in a dedicated git worktree. The main worktree is never touched during development.

```
/superpowers:using-git-worktrees
```

This creates an isolated working directory linked to the same git repository. All subsequent steps happen inside this worktree. The worktree skill creates and checks out a branch — this is the branch you will push in Step 8.

---

## Step 2: Analyze the Issue and Source Code

Inside the worktree, before writing any plan or code:

- Read the issue carefully and identify the exact problem or feature requested.
- Explore the relevant source files and understand the existing structure.
- Note affected files, dependencies, edge cases, and risks.

When using Claude Code, use the built-in Grep tool to search rather than shell `grep`.

---

## Step 3: Plan with `/superpowers:writing-plans`

Invoke the planning skill to structure your implementation plan:

```
/superpowers:writing-plans
```

The skill guides the planning process. Save the resulting plan to `docs/plans/` using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>-plan.md`. The plan must include: goal, architecture, exact file paths, step-by-step tasks with code, and a commit message per task.

`docs/plans/` is listed in `.gitignore` — plan files never appear in PRs.

---

## Step 4: Review the Plan with an Agent

Have an agent critique the plan before presenting it to the human. Pass the plan file path to a review agent:

```
/research-ideas:_review-plan
```

> Note: `_review-plan` is an internal sub-skill. If unavailable, ask a general-purpose agent to review the plan file directly by providing its path.

The agent should check for:
- Missing steps or ambiguities
- Edge cases not covered
- Consistency with existing repo patterns

Incorporate feedback into the plan before proceeding.

---

## Step 5: Human Gate

**Do not write any implementation code before this step is complete.**

Summarize the finalized plan for the human contributor:

1. State the issue being addressed.
2. List the files that will be created or modified.
3. Describe the approach in 2–3 sentences.
4. Show the task breakdown at a high level.

**Wait for explicit human approval** (e.g., "looks good", "proceed") before moving to Step 6.

---

## Step 6: Implement Step by Step

Invoke the subagent-driven development skill to execute the approved plan. This drives each task in sequence within the current session, using a fresh subagent per task with a review checkpoint between tasks:

```
/superpowers:subagent-driven-development
```

- Mark each task complete before starting the next.
- Keep changes focused — no scope creep.
- Commit after each task using the message from the plan.
- Run tests after each task if applicable.

---

## Step 7: Review the Implementation

Once all tasks are complete, run a comprehensive PR review using specialized agents before opening the PR:

```
/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr
```

Address all issues found before proceeding.

---

## Step 8: Create the PR

Confirm your current branch name (set by the worktree in Step 1), then push and open a PR to the upstream repository.

```bash
# Confirm branch name
git branch --show-current

# Push to your fork
git push -u origin <your-branch-name>

# Open PR to upstream
gh pr create \
  --repo AI-native-Systems-Research/agentic-strategy-evolution \
  --title "<concise title>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
